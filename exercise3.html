<h1 style="color: palevioletred;">Hello everyone, my name is Ira Najwa Binti Roslan.My age is 22years old this year.</h1>
<p style="color: black;">I Begin my primary education at Sekolah Kebangsaan Kem, Pengkalan Chepa in Kelantan, where I
     studied from Standard 1 to Standard 6. I then continued my secondary education at Sekolah Menengah
     Kebangsaan Pengkalan Chepa 1, 16100 Kota Bharu, Kelantan. In Form 1, I enrolled in
     a class that included Arabic language studies. During Form 2 and Form 3, I continued in the general
     academic stream. In Form 4 and Form 5, I pursued a course stream focused on Tasawur
     Islam and Gerontology. After completing SPM, I remained at the same school to pursue my
     STPM (Malaysian Higher School Certificate) for one and a half years in the Arts stream.
     Following that, I pursued my higher education at Universiti Malaysia Perlis (UniMAP), where 
     I obtained a Bachelorâ€™s Degree in New Media Communication.</p>
